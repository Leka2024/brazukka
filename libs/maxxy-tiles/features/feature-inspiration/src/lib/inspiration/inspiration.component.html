        <h3>Magnetic Connectivity</h3>
        <span>The most prominent features of magnetic tiles is their magnetic connectivity. Each  tile has magnetics on its ediges, which attract and stick to the magnets on the neighboring tiles. This makes it easy to connect and disconnect the peaces, allowing for endless building possibilities.</span>
